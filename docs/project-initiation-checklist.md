# Project Initiation Checklist

This checklist complements the [Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md) with a concise set of steps to ensure projects start with clear scope, aligned stakeholders, and proper documentation.

## Define the Project

- [ ] Create project one-pager with the following sections:

  - [ ] Target users or customers
  - [ ] High-level solution approach
  - [ ] Key stakeholders and their roles
  - [ ] Estimated timeline and milestones
  - [ ] Dependencies and constraints
  - [ ] Out of scope items

- [ ] Validate problem statement with stakeholders
- [ ] Confirm success metrics are measurable and realistic
- [ ] Identify and document key assumptions and risks

## Stakeholder Alignment

- [ ] Identify all stakeholders (Product Manager, Project Manager, Engineering Lead, QA Lead, etc.)
- [ ] Schedule project kickoff meeting
- [ ] Share one-pager with stakeholders for review and feedback
- [ ] Obtain stakeholder approval to proceed to planning
- [ ] Clarify decision-making authority and escalation path
- [ ] Confirm communication cadence (standups, status updates, demos)
